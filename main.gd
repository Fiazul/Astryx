# Floating origin: the Ship node stays pinned at (0,0,0) and only rotates. Its
# "true" position is tracked as data (ship.true_pos). Every body is rendered at
# (body.true_pos - ship.true_pos), and the starfield is a fixed backdrop on the
# world root (NOT a child of the ship), so it doesn't spin with the ship.
#
# Update order matters and is driven explicitly here: the ship integrates its
# motion first, then the planet system reads the fresh true_pos, then the HUD.
